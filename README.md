# RestaurantPOS
 Point of sale (POS) or point of purchase is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. In restaurant business, POS systems often include table reservation, ordering food, alerts, billing, credit card processing and customer management. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, POS systems had gained traction across the industry. During the coronavirus pandemic, restaurants face greater peril than ever. Such systems are expected to increase business intelligence, reduce wasted effort and opportunity to scale to a large business.
